01. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

*When you increase the number of hidden nodes (neurons in the hidden layer):

*The network becomes more powerful (it can learn more complex shapes/relationships).

*It can separate the two classes (moons dataset) more accurately.

*Accuracy on the training set usually goes up.


02. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

(i)Very few hidden nodes (1–2):

*Model is too simple.

*Can’t capture curves in the data.

*Accuracy stays low (~50–70%).

*Underfitting.

(ii) Moderate hidden nodes (3–10):

*Model gets enough flexibility to draw curved boundaries.

*Accuracy increases (~85–95%).

*This is usually the sweet spot.

*Large hidden nodes (20–50+):

(iii)Model fits the training data almost perfectly.

*Accuracy may reach ~99–100%.

*But decision boundary may become too complex → it “memorizes” the training set.

*On new data, accuracy might drop. (Overfitting).
